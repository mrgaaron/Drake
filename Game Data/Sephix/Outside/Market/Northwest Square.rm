Title:
Sephix - Northwest Market Square
==
Description:
The sole shop in this corner of the market is the blacksmith.  The echoing of
hammers against iron can be heard emanating from the door.  Smoke billows from
the building's chimney.  A few heavily armed customers continuously enter and
exit through the door, no doubt readying themselves for an expedition in the
wild country outside Sephix.
