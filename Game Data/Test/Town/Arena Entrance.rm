Title:
Entrance to the Arena
==
Description:
Compared to the busy town square, the area around the arena is eerily quiet.  A
few birds chirp every so often from the elm trees lining the imposing entrance 
to the city arena.  The massive doors are flanked by the statues of the arena's
two most infamous champions - Malacath and Molag, as if they stand in judgment
over those who would dare enter to compete.
