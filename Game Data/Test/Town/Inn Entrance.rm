Title:
Entrance to the Inn
==
Description:
The entrance to the inn makes it appear as busy as the town square you just 
left behind.  Travelers stream in and out of its doors, laden with baggage 
from their travels.  The air is alive with the sounds of unfamiliar dialects
and accents. A pair of lit torches flank the doorway, giving the inn a warm 
and inviting feel.
